# Grindmeter

GrindMeter is a highly customizable focus timer and session tracker that helps you enterâ€”and stay inâ€”flow, then turns your work into statistics by subject and time. 

## Highlights

- View your study history as interactable lines charts or pie charts
- Custom focus options (sound ambience and "focus" mode)

## Problem Solved ðŸš€
 
Staying focused is hard, especially in college. I built Grindmeter to cut the noise and keep you in flow. Grindmeter allows you to work in focused blocks, and turns each session into simple statistics. By making session data easily accessible, you can be motivated to work harder and improve your numbers or learn to optimize your work habits.
